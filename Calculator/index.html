            As a pure mathematics graduate student, I was a teaching assistant and had to grade quizzes and worksheets 
            on solving quadratic equations and system of linear equations. I would do these exercises 
            first to find their answers and then grade my students' work. Now I wanted to build a site
            that would make this easier, but how? 
          </p>

            After learning JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and getting exposed to AWS technologies during an 
            online training, I researched how to host on an AWS S3 bucket. Then I constructed this 
            sites' pages locally that would solve any quadratic equation or system of equations 
            it was given! After uploading these files to an AWS S3 bucket, anyone can use this site 
            and cut their grading load in half!
