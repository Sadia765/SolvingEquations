            I studied Mathematics and Computer Science at
            <a href="https://www.luc.edu/">Loyola University Chicago</a>. As an
            undergraduate, I did a research project that combined both my
            interests. In May 2017, I graduated Loyola with a Bachelor of
            Science in Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science.
          </p>

          <p>
            Following Loyola, I pursued a Master of Science in Mathematics,
            graduating from
            <a href="https://www.depaul.edu/Pages/default.aspx">
              DePaul University Chicago
            </a>
            in June 2019. During my time at DePaul, I worked as a teaching
            assistant for Intermediate Algebra, Calculus I-III, Linear Algebra,
            and two graduate courses, namely Fields and Galois Theory and
            Partial Differential Equations. Now, I work as a Professional Tutor
            at <a href="https://www.oakton.edu/">Oakton Community College</a>,
            tutoring mathematics.

          <p>
            Since graduating DePaul, I have reconnected with my computer science
            interests. I have self-taught myself JavaScript by reading and doing
            exercises on
            <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a>,
            <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard">HackerRank</a>,
            <a href="https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/">LeetCode</a>, and
            <a href="https://www.algoexpert.io/product">AlgoExpert</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            This past Summer, June 2020 - August 2020, I did two full-time
            trainings, hosted by Revature, that covered JavaScript, HTML, CSS,
            Java, Angular, SQL, and AWS concepts. I recently passed a
            <a href="JavaScriptCertification_w3schools.pdf"> JavaScript </a>
            certification from W3Schools.
          </p>

          <p>
            I built this site to practice my HTML, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and
            CSS skills and to learn about setting up an AWS S3 bucket.
